# ML-2019SK project

In this project, by building a machine learning code that relays on Random forest algorithm and two CNN (2D and 3D) we will try to pick P- and S- waves in real-time and after that we will measure the satisfaction of the readings and prediction to show the efficiency of our model then we will perform some test to make sure the model is robust enough
